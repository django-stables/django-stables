Django Stables
==============

Django Stables is a cross-project test metrics for Django and related "stable" packages.

Objectives
----------
1. To provide a central location that shows the stability of various Django related packages with reference to the supported and development versions of Django.
2. To collect code coverage of Django as used by other packages to provide insight into which Django features are used or not.
3. To educate developers on the importance of not just TDD, but how testing metrics can be useful to a wider audience.
